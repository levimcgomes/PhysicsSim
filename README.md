# PhysicsSim
A physics simulator, based on the book [Game Physics Engine Development](https://theswissbay.ch/pdf/Gentoomen%20Library/Game%20Development/Programming/Game%20Physics%20Engine%20Development.pdf) by Ian Millington. You can find the repository for the simulator built on that book at https://github.com/idmillington/cyclone-physics/.

This repository is a companion for the series on my [blog](https://levimcgomes.github.io) on physics simulation.
